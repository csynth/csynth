*atoms
The capsid or shell is made up of lots of atoms.
*-
Here we see the atoms in fairly random positions.

*residues
Atoms group in amino acids.
*
There are only 20 different ways atoms form amino acids.
these different amino acid types are coloured.

*chains1
Amino acids join to form protein chains.
*
We colour the amino acids to show the protein chains they belong to.

*chains2
The amino acids connect to line up in their protein chains.

*secstruct
Protein chains fold into 'secondary structures'.
*
green sheets and red helices.

*chaingroup
Protein chains come together into a compact group.

*ggdone
We have seen
atoms => amino acids => protein chains =>
        secondary structures => group
*-
The atoms have made amino acids which collected in protein chains,
the protein chains have been structured and collected in a group.

*constrend
...

*single
The capsid has 60 groups arranged by symmetric rotation.
Here is a single group.
we will see it rotate itself to the full 60.

*pre5
First, 5-fold rotation: 1 group => 5

*pre2
2-fold rotation: 5 groups => 10

*pre3
3-fold rotation  10 groups => 30

*pre2x
final 2-fold rotation: 30 groups => 60

*symend
The full symmetric capsid shell structure has 60 parts,
made by multiple rotations about different axes;
5-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold and another 2-fold for a total of 60.

*isweep
Move both hands visible in front of face;
move together and apart to see
symmetric building of the capsid.

Select a virus from the menu to end.

*endisweep
Interactive sweep ended.

*SV40_hover
Emergent Human Pathogen Simian Virus

60 white kites
60 green diamonds
30 red diamonds

*HSV1_hover
Herpes Simplex Virus

12 white pentagons
150 red, green and blue hexagons
320 triangles of various colours

*****
The colouring on the hexagons depends on
their relationship to the pentagons,
and the colouring on the triangles
to their relationship to all the larger polygons.

*PAV_hover
PaV: Pariacoto Virus

60 white triangles

*MS2_hover
Bacteriophage MS2

60 white diamonds
30 red diamonds

*TRSV_hover
Tobacco Ringspot Virus

60 white kites

*both_hover
Display both capsid and tiling

*capsid_hover
Display just the capsid

*tiling_hover
Display just the tiling.
The tiling will be shown as coloured planes.
